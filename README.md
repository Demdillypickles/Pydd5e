Tools to help manage a 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons session


Dungeons and Dragons is an amazing game, and the tabletop platform allows your imagination to be the engine that renders the game world.
However, being bound to pencil and paper can make for slow-paced sessions that get bogged down in page flipping, handwriting,
and general inexperience with the game.

The goal of this repository is to produce a set of tools with a GUI, to help speed up the slower parts of a standard D&D game.
